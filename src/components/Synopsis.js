          They say never meet your heroes. But what if your hero, like Margot K.
          Juby’s, is a 15th century serial killer? Gilles de Rais was a
          nobleman, decorated military statesman—and one of the grisliest
          murderers in recorded history. Or, at least, that’s what history tells
          us. But Margot’s fanatical, 20-year long research project suggests
          otherwise. According to her, de Rais was the victim of a vast
          conspiracy. She’s so sure that she has “Gilles de Rais was innocent”
          tattooed on her arm. <br/><br/>
          
          The Martyr interweaves the deeply personal story
          of how Margot came to fall in love with de Rais, with a gothic,
          animated retelling of the nobleman’s life. Along the way, the film
          uncovers an amusing plot by the French intelligentsia to exonerate the
          nobleman, and a potential conspiracy at the heart of the medieval
          French court. Painting an eerie, paranoid—yet compassionate—portrait
          of unrequited love, The Martyr is a film about the dark obsessions
          that shape all of us.
